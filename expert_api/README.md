# Truffle Expert API Service

The Expert API Service provides fast, read-only access to expert search functionality for the Truffle system. It offers RESTful endpoints for querying user expertise based on skills, technologies, or domains, with support for confidence filtering, time-based relevance, and flexible search strategies. The API serves as the backend for both the Slack Bot and any future integrations, delivering expert recommendations.
