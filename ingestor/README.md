# Truffle Ingestor Service

The Ingestor Service is the core data processing component of Truffle that automatically analyzes Slack conversations to identify user expertise. It periodically ingests messages from public Slack channels, extracts mentioned skills and technologies, classifies the level of expertise demonstrated in each message, and maintains aggregated skill scores for users. The service handles the complete pipeline from message collection to expertise evidence storage, enabling the system to build a comprehensive map of organizational knowledge and expertise.
